ðŸš€ House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
I built a House Price Prediction System that leverages Regression techniques to estimate housing prices based on multiple features.
ðŸ”¹ What I did
Trained a Linear Regression model on housing data (features like median income, house age, number of rooms, population, etc.).
Explored feature relationships through correlation analysis and visualization.
Built both simple regression (1 feature â†’ price) and multiple regression (many features â†’ price) models.
Evaluated model performance using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Saved predictions into CSV for real-world batch testing.
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Regression models (Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression)
ðŸ”¹ Key Outcomes
âœ… Built a predictive pipeline for estimating housing prices.
âœ… Learned how feature scaling and correlation affect regression performance.
âœ… Compared simple vs. multiple regression to show how adding features improves accuracy.
âœ… Gained hands-on experience in building interpretable models for continuous data.
This project strengthened my ability to apply regression for real-world business insights, bridging data exploration, modeling, and evaluation.
